# Online Fraud Detection through Behaviour and Location Analysis

Transaction fraud imposes serious threats on e-commerce shopping. As online transaction is becoming more popular the types of online transaction frauds associated with this are also rising which affects the financial industry. This fraud detection system has the capability to restrict and block the transaction performed by the attacker from genuine userâ€™s credit card details.
During registration we take required information which is efficient to detect fraudulent user activity. The details of items purchased by any Individual transaction are usually not known to any Fraud Detection System (FDS) running at the bank that issues credit cards to the cardholders. BLA (Behaviour and Location Analysis) is implemented for addressing this problem. Each incoming transaction is submitted to the FDS for verification. FDS receives the card details and transaction value to verify, whether the transaction is genuine or not. Bank declines the transaction if FDS confirms the transaction to be fraud. User spending patterns and geographical location is used to verify the identity. If any unusual pattern is detected, the system requires re-verification. Based upon previous data of that user, the system recognizes unusual patterns in the payment procedure. After 3 invalid attempts the system will block the user. Our algorithm will calculate deviation from the normal behaviour of the user using the above parameters. If this deviation is more than 25% then the transaction will be considered invalid and will be immediately cancelled and the account will be blocked. We have also added two factor authentication built upon the principles of public-key cryptography; Digital fingerprinting adds another layer of security to the system.
